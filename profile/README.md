# [Welcome!](https://deaconn.net/)
Hello! [Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/) is a community and future software developer with the goal to bring together and empower developers, and engineers.

Deaconn, initially founded in 2021 as a personal portfolio for Christian Deacon, underwent a complete overhaul in 2023. Its new mission is to create open source services, applications, and frameworks for the benefit of the community. Additionally, Deaconn features a rather unique blog with informative articles, providing users with valuable insights. Users can also showcase their projects, experiences, and skills, creating a dynamic platform akin to a personalized portfolio.
