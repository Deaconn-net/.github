# [Welcome To Deaconn!](https://deaconn.net/)
Hello! [Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/) is a website that provides my portfolio, activity via a custom blog, projects, social media links, and more!

I use Django's web framework that utilizes Python for the back-end and Bootstrap as a CSS library for the front-end. However, I did make the design itself from scratch!

## Blog Features
You can check out the current blog [here](https://deaconn.net/blog)! Additionally, the blog supports the following.

* A custom admin interface for creating blog posts.
* Category and tag support.
* Header images and a short description.
* Markdown support for both the description and body!
* Comment support for logged in users (front-end user login system not made yet).
* Buttons to share the blog post on Twitter and other platforms.
* Real-time visibility on what your Markdown will look like (see below).

This blog was custom-made myself. While I did use Django's modular system, I did implement many of the features seen above!

## Installation
For installation and deployment, please visit [this](https://github.com/Deaconn-net/Infrastructure) repository! This includes all files and information on how to install this application to production.
